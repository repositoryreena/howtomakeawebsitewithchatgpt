      <h2>💡 The Idea</h2>
      <p>I asked an AI assistant to help me build a site documenting the process of building the site... with AI!</p>

      <h2>📖 How to Build a Website with AI</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Think of an idea:</strong> What do you want your website to do or say?</li>
        <li><strong>Open AI Assistant:</strong> Tell it your idea. Ask it to help you build a website using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
        <li><strong>Work step-by-step:</strong> Ask the assistant to generate each file (index.html, style.css, script.js) and explain what each part does.</li>
        <li><strong>Set up your files:</strong> Create a folder and add the files the assistant gives you. Open them with a browser or code editor like VS Code.</li>
        <li><strong>Test and iterate:</strong> Check the site, ask for changes or improvements (animations, effects, responsiveness).</li>
        <li><strong>Make it mobile responsive:</strong> Add CSS media queries and test using the browser's developer tools (press <code>F12</code> and click the <strong>Toggle Device Toolbar</strong> icon).</li>
        <li><strong>Deploy it on Netlify:</strong> Go to <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netlify</a>, sign in, and drag your project folder (with index.html inside) into the dashboard to publish it instantly.</li>
        <li><strong>Optionally, link your AI conversation:</strong> So others can see how it was made step by step.</li>
      </ol>
